            <div class="name">Pikachu</div>
            <p>Pikachu is a playable character, and the only Pokémon that is playable from the start of the game. Its main stage is Saffron City.
               In the hands of a skilled player, Pikachu is not to be taken lightly. 
                Alongside electrical attacks, it has very good aerial attacks and superb, but hard to master, recovery move. 
                Pikachu is also one of the lightest characters in the game, making it easy for its foes to launch it. 
                Despite this, top-level SSB players have placed Pikachu at the top of their list, theoretically making it the best character in the game.</p>

        <div id="pokemon2" class="card">
                <img src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/a6/Jigglypuff_SSB4.png">
                <div class="name">Jigglypuff</div>
                <p>Jigglypuff is a playable character, but it must be unlocked by clearing the 1-Player mode with any character. 
                    Jigglypuff has one of the best recoveries in the game and can use its low-power aerial attacks to combo larger and heavier opponents easily, 
                    but it also the lightest character and thus very easy to knock off the stage. Jigglypuff shares the Saffron City stage with Pikachu.</p>

        <div id="pokemon3" class="card">
                <img src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/af/Lucario_SSB4.png">
                <div class="name">Lucario</div>
                <p>Lucario is a character with a unique mechanic - the vast majority of its attacks use aura to damage opponents. 
                    Aura attacks get smaller and weaker when Lucario is at low damage, while they get larger and stronger at high damage - 
                    a fresh Lucario will only be doing 0.7x damage, while one at 170% or above will be doing 1.4x damage. Aura is also stronger 
                    when Lucario is losing the match, and weaker when it is ahead. This makes Lucario the ultimate risk-reward character, encouraging 
                    close matches and come-from-behind victories.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="pokemon4" class="card">
                <img src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/c/c1/Charizard_SSB4.png">
                <div class="name">Charizard</div>
                <p>Charizard appears as a Pokémon that can be randomly summoned from a Poké Ball. When Charizard appears, it attacks the enemies 
                    of the player/team that summoned it with a scorching Flamethrower while turning its head from left to right. The attack deal 
                    6% damage per flame in both games.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="pokemon5" class="card favorite">
                <img src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/d/da/Mewtwo_SSB4.png/600px-Mewtwo_SSB4.png">
                <div class="name">Mewtwo</div>
                <p>Mewtwo has an unusual combination of attributes. Unlike other characters, its throws are exceedingly powerful, 
                    capable of KO'ing at similar percentages as smash attacks. It also boasts several fast attacks that can be linked 
                    together for simple and effective combos, and possesses an exceptional recovery. However, it is rather light, moves and 
                    falls slowly, and is a large target, making it easy to combo back. It also has difficulties KO'ing opponents - while its 
                    throws are strong, it needs to get grabs first, and its other KO moves are either slow or have short range.</p>

                <div class="name">Entei</div>
                <p>Entei is first encountered in Mystical Forest, looking for Celebi. He meets the player, their partner, and the Expedition Society's 
                    Archen near Latios and Latias, who have recently been turned to stone. He suspects them of being the culprits of turning others to stone, 
                    but Archen tells him that he is part of the Expedition Society. Entei disappears after telling them that the next time they meet, he will 
                    not be merciful.</p>
