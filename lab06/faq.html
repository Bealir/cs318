            <h3>Does Social Security offer special services to disaster victims?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Yes.  We understand how devastating and disorienting things can be when disaster strikes. 
            Thatâ€™s why we offer expedited handling of Social Security services for disaster victims.  
            When you contact us under these circumstances, please let us know that you are a disaster victim.  
            We will follow our special Disaster Procedures in handing your Social Security service needs.</p>

            <h3>How long will it take to get a Social Security card?</h3>
            <p class="answer">We will mail your Social Security card as soon as we have all of the necessary information. 
            For Form I-765, we will issue your card as soon as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
            (USCIS) approves your employment authorization. Generally, you will get your card within 10-14 business days 
            from the date your application is processed.</p>

            <h3>What happens if I work and get Social Security retirement benefits?</h3>
            <p class="answer">You can get Social Security retirement benefits and work at the same time. However, if you are younger than full 
            retirement age and make more than the yearly earnings limit, we will reduce your benefit. Starting with the month 
            you reach full retirement age, we will not reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn.</p>
