        <h2>Welcome to Minneapolis!</h2>
        <h3>Home of the Vikings!</h3>
        <p>Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle, with Minneapolis proper containing America's tenth-highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies. As an integral link to the global economy, Minneapolis is categorized as a global city.

                Minneapolis has one of the largest LGBT populations in the U.S. in terms of its number of openly gay politicians, gay wedding ceremonies, pride events and gay-inclusive religious organizations, relative to the size of the total population of the city. Noted for its strong music and performing arts scenes, Minneapolis is home to both the award-winning Guthrie Theater and the historic First Avenue nightclub. Reflecting the region's status as an epicenter of folk, funk, and alternative rock music, the city served as the launching pad for several of the 20th century's most influential musicians, including Bob Dylan and Prince.</p>
