					<p>Unmanned aerial systems are incredibly useful tools that bring a whole new perspective to any form of photography. Find out how you can use aerial photography to your advantage.
						I am a certified pilot under the FAA’s 14 CFR Part 107, with the majority of my experience being with quadcopters (drones). This platform allows for photography that is much less expensive and more easily accessible than using helicopters or planes.		
						I look forward to working together with you to provide an excellent experience and top quality photography at an affordable price. Contact me and let’s get started!
