					<p>I very much enjoy flying drones as a hobbyist, and decided that I would take it to the next level by becoming certified by the Federal Aviation Administration under 14 CFR Part 107 with a small unmanned aerial systems rating.</p>

					<p>I got my start in the unmanned aerial systems industry through the geography and geospatial technology department at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. After taking their UAS class, I purchased my first drone and began experimenting with aerial photography.

                            I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, where I am pursuing a degree in Geospatial Technology. I enjoy being outdoors doing various activities such as hunting, fishing, hiking, and photography. Unmanned aerial systems allow me to experience photography from a perspective not often seen by the human eye.
